# Data-Engineering-YouTube-Data-Analysis-with-AWS

## Overview
This initiative seeks to implement a secure and efficient system for the organized handling, streamlining, and analysis of structured and semi-structured data from YouTube videos. The focus is on categorizing videos and analyzing trending metrics in a secure manner.

## Project Goals
 1) Data Ingestion Mechanism: Develop a robust mechanism for ingesting data from diverse sources.

 2) ETL System Implementation: Transform raw data into the appropriate format to facilitate effective analysis.

 3) Data Lake Repository: Establish a centralized repository in the form of a data lake to store information obtained from multiple sources.

 4) Scalability Assurance: Ensure the scalability of the system to accommodate growing data volumes seamlessly.

 5) Cloud Integration (AWS): Leverage cloud computing, specifically AWS, for processing vast amounts of data, as local computers may be insufficient for such tasks.

 6) Reporting Dashboard: Construct a comprehensive dashboard to obtain insights and answers to the questions posed during analysis.
